# Project base logical
## Every time attack, we presume 4 possible: 
### 1 health survival from attack and eliminate all zombie
### 2 health be bite and part of them will transform to zombie
### 3 health be bite and part of them will transform to zombie but all zombie also be eliminated.
### 4 health vitality or learning_ability is too low(default set <80) would be transfer to zombie

# Features:
### 1 Zombie and Health-people would be grouped into several groups
### 2 Zombie will surfer starved and dead of lack food.
### 3 Health-people have learning ability that improve survival probability after survival from every time zombie attack

# Improving :
## 1 add health be bite and transfer probability
## 2 add relationship between health learning-ability and survival probability
